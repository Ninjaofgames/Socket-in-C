# Socket-in-C
It's a socket developed using C language. A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport one, it's the "API(Application Programming Interface) Internet".

# Note
I used #include <winsock2.h> and #include <ws2tcpip> , so every function related to it may not work in the other operating systems (Linux, MacOS).
